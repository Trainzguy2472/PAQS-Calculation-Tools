# PAQS-Calculation-Tools
Tools and documentation for the **Pedestrian Access Quality Score (PAQS)**, a metric developed at UC Berkeley to measure the quality of pedestrian access routes to rapid transit stations.

## 🔍 About the Metric
PAQS is designed to assess the quality of pedestrian access to transit through the lenses of route directness and perceived safety. The score is intended to support urban planning, transportation research, and accessibility studies.

## 📁 Repository Contents
- `PAQS_Calculator.xlsx`

## 🛠️ How to Use These Tools
1. Read the Methodology section of the thesis for an overview of how the metric works and how it is calculated.
2. For each station you choose to analyze, open **ONE** 
3. The PAQS will be calculated automatically using the embedded formulas.
4. Refer to `Methodology_Summary.pdf` for an explanation of the variables and scoring logic.
